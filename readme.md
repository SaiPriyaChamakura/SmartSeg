[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://smartseg-kn6vrjntmccyre3hgmystm.streamlit.app/)



SmartSeg is an **AI-driven inventory intelligence system** built using **Streamlit, Python, and Ollama (Phi model)**.  
It combines **ABC–XYZ classification**, **safety stock optimization**, and **AI-generated operational insights**  
to help manufacturing and supply chain teams improve **safety, quality, productivity, delivery, and cost**.

✅ **ABC × XYZ Classification**  
Automatically segments items based on annual value (ABC) and demand variability (XYZ).

✅ **Dynamic SKU Simulation**  
Interactively test how changing criticality or urgency impacts item priority and reorder logic.

✅ **Pareto & Heatmap Visuals**  
Visualize cost distribution and class interactions to focus on the most impactful SKUs.

✅ **Safety Stock & Reorder Point Automation**  
Built-in calculators using service level targets and lead time variability.

✅ **AI-Powered Insights (Local LLM)**  
Uses the **Ollama Phi** model to generate actionable insights directly from your inventory data —  
no API keys or internet connection required.

✅ **“Ask Your Data” Chatbot**  
Query your live dataset in natural language and receive AI-driven, context-aware answers.

✅ **Policy Recommendation Engine**  
Automatically suggests replenishment and review policies based on item classification and urgency.

## 🏭 Why SmartSeg?

Traditional inventory systems often:
- Struggle to adapt to **new or urgent items** without past demand.
- Lack **contextual intelligence** to prioritize what truly matters.
- Offer static insights that don’t integrate with AI reasoning.

SmartSeg solves these problems with:
- **Dynamic AI reasoning** over live data.
- **Hybrid logic (ABC + XYZ + Criticality + Urgency)**.
- **Actionable policy recommendations** generated automatically.
